# InVision This

## So much more than fancy screenshots

### 3 minute read

As you’ve probably gathered if you’ve been following along, we spend a lot of time talking about tools. In some cases, too much time. Tools, after all, don’t make the craftsman. But after a week of using InVision.app for a project of some complexity, I’d have to say: Wow.

I’ve been aware of InVision for awhile, but always thought of it as a fancy presentation tool (which it is) and nothing more (which it isn’t). You do all the real design work in another tool like Sketch, Illustrator, or Photoshop, right? Well, yeah, but…

## Dat UI tho

Astute UXers who have done any prototyping will probably point to Axure as *the* tool for building complex user interface prototypes without the need to code. And Axure is where I started my journey for this project. This was the one that I was going to finally invest the time in, to finally get over the Axure learning curve and start using it as god intended.

Truth be told, I just couldn’t get into it.

While the bottom line is that Axure packs a ton of functionality into a client-side tool, its arcane UI and workflow left me cold. InVision, on the other hand, had me productive in a few minutes. And the way their help documentation explains the tool is [as straight ahead as Wayne Shorter meets Herbie Hancock][1]. Even though it was my first project, I never felt like I was dealing with a learning curve. And every corner I turned in the app surprised me with another “you can *do* that?” moment of existential coolness. The fact that it produces visually stunning results doesn’t hurt either.

## Workflow-friendly

What’s more, the integrative and collaborative aspects of InVision are where it really shines.

## The right tool

Can you do more with Axure than InVision? Certainly. Can you do *enough* with InVision to get your point across quickly, conveniently, and effectively? Definitely. InVision wins because it meets the minimum viable product criteria for UI wire framing and prototyping. Until I get to a point where InVision doesn’t meet my needs, I’m pretty much sold on it.

You can go see what all the fuss is about by [checking out the wireframes in question][2], first-hand.
