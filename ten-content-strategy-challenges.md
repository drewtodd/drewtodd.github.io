Ten Content Strategy Challenges (and How to Overcome Them)
==========================================================

Content strategy is an important component of the design process and vital to the overall user experience. Additionally, it ensures that the organization’s content aligns with its goals and values. With that in mind, here are ten key challenges that content creators and management face with content strategy, and some proposed solutions.

Challenges for Content Creators
-------------------------------
You content creators and strategists have it rough. Slogging it out in the trenches, you often see first-hand some of the impediments that constantly threaten your productivity, the quality of your work, and [your sanity][8]; often without the political clout or influence to effect a change. But it doesn't have to be like this. Here are the top issues you've likely to encountered, and some practical soltuions.

### 1. Lack of management buy-in

This is probably the single largest obstacle for content strategy in organizations. Management doesn’t see the need for it, doesn’t have a sense of urgency for it, or just plain doesn’t understand it.

**Solution:** [Find an influential ally in management][6] who can help champion your cause and educate them on the high points of content strategy. Additionally, starting with a small “stealth” project and establishing a pattern of success will help sell content strategy. Little victories will lead to larger buy-in from management.

### 2. Unclear governance and editorial policies
Unclear editorial policies lead to inconsistent content across the organization’s delivery channels. Different content creators often do their own thing and the result is a lack of cohesiveness. Even worse, the content created may not promote the organization's values or help achieve its goals. Without clear governance guidelines for when and how content is deployed and how it is managed, the organization’s content landscape can quickly become cluttered, disorganized, or seemingly abandoned.

**Solution:** Work with management and content creators to develop a clear editorial style guide; stick to it, and keep it up-to-date. Define the organization’s oversight policies. Document the review and approval process for all content and maintain an active and thorough publication schedule.

### 3. Unclear roles and responsibilities
Who is the content owner? Who is responsible for publishing content to the various channels we want to target? Who approves content, and how do we know when it is ready to publish? Questions like these arise when the roles and responsibilities of the content team(s) are not clearly identified. Add to that the fact that content is being created on different teams throughout the organization and communication silos arise; consistency in quality and pacing becomes difficult to maintain.

**Solution:** Acknowledging that this is a problem and facilitating communication within and between teams is critical. [Margot Bloomstein][1] describes the solution as creating a culture of sharing, education and maintenance. Sitting down with the key players initially to clearly identify roles and responsibilities and establish open lines of communication breaks down organizational silos and gives content creators a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities.

### 4. Poor (or non-existing) tools
In some cases, organizations do not have tools to facilitate the content workflow. Even more common is the case where these tools exist but only serve to hinder productivity. IT, developers and management are often more impressed with a content management system (CMS) feature-set than they are in how the tool actually fits with the organization’s content deliverables and information structure.

**Solution:**  Organizations without a CMS should definitely invest in one, but even before that Bloomstein recommends developing a content model that defines relationships between content types and among their constituent attributes. This activity is still valuable if you already have a CMS that isn’t working for you as well as it should. Once you’ve identified the structure of your content-environment, you can adjust your tools to work toward it, instead of the other way around.

### 5. Content refactoring
Gone are the days when content was created for a single purpose or audience. Content creators today are faced with the reality that content needs to be malleable enough to work in many different contexts. Or, as [Brad Frost puts it][3], “Get your content ready to go anywhere. Because it’s going to go everywhere.” This challenge of content refactoring includes tailoring and repackaging content for different audiences; force-fitting content into specific modules, templates and content types,5 not to mention localization of content and the myriad headaches that this creates.

**Solution:** This is a tough reality to deal with and there is no simple solution. In my experience, the best approach is to clearly identify (as clearly as you can, anyway) the channels that you are targeting up front. A scope meeting with stakeholders and the team is an ideal place to do this. Address these targets early and give them full consideration while creating the message. Ideally, your content model will allow you to link different versions of the message together in (again, ideally) your CMS. Finally, establish style guides for the different message contexts (how are tweets laid out and voiced, versus LinkedIn posts, versus website features, versus press releases?) and stick to them. As with all style guides, revisit often and revise as needed.


Challenges for Management
-------------------------
Leadership faces a similar predicament. With so much emphasis put on productivity, efficiency and the bottom line, it's hard to embrace a concept that doesn't show a clear benefit for the organization, introduces too much risk or just doesn't fit in with their vision of the company and its values. If you're a manager, or you're trying to convince executives to embrace content strategy, these challenges are probably all-to-familiar.

### 1. No visible ROI
The most common content strategy challenge with management is the issue of return on investment. Executives often fail to see the value in content strategy, viewing it as an unnecessary investment or - worse - a waste of valuable resources and time.

**Solution:** Content strategy advocates must find ways to demonstrate value, through measurement and monitoring of key performance indicators that map directly to the organization’s values (a good analytics package helps). Without demonstrated value, management will not invest in content strategy. [Kate Kenyon astutely observes][6] that focusing on the solution - instead of the process - and putting that solution in management’s terms is an effective means of adopting buy-in.

### 2. No tolerance for failure
Management - and business in general - is hard-wired to avoid failure at all costs. Failure, however, is an important part of change and process improvement: Often it’s just as useful to discover what does not work as what does. This is especially true in a complex process like developing and implementing a content strategy. 

**Solution:** Failure is a part of change and, [as Dan and Chip Heath state][2], “You need to create the expectation of failure - not the failure of the mission itself, but failure en route.” Create this expectation by explaining your process and making it clear that small setbacks in the interim will only help ensure a successful end result. Finally - and this may seem obvious - don’t over-promote failures. Be forthright and honest, but focus on wins; not losses.

### 3. Lack of empathy for the user
Management often looks at the problem exclusively from the business perspective (generate sales, leads, etc.) and fails to consider the needs of the customer, or - more likely - is framing their understanding of customer needs and goals based on marketing data or their own personal perspective.1

**Solution:** In my experience, creating personas is an effective means of introducing management to their users in some cases, although not all managers buy into them. Recording user research and presenting it to management is also effective. It lets them see and hear for themselves what their users’ issues and goals are. The most effective method (and, admittedly, the most difficult to facilitate) is to have management hear it directly from the users themselves. In all cases, being able to tell management “We talked to the people who will be using this content and these are the issues they pointed out” is very effective in building empathy. For all of these to work, you’ll need access to users, either directly or indirectly.

### 4. Unclear understanding of the playing field
Many executives lack understanding of emerging content platforms like social media. Website? Sure. SEO? Sure. Instagram? Notsomuch. The new stuff evades them and they cannot grasp the value nor the tactics necessary to fully harness these new channels.

**Solution:** Look at your competitors. Are they effectively using these new media? Listen to your users. Are they engaged? Do they express value in seeing your content in these channels? Look at emerging trends. Find articles and studies that illuminate the value of these new channels or detail effective strategies for using them. Take this information to the decision-makers and present it in a clear, concise, results-oriented manner. Get them in a room; present slides; encourage questions. 

### 5. Politics over priorities
It exists in every organization: The political pitfall. Management is often more concerned with political issues surrounding their day-to-day office reality than long term priorities like a cohesive content strategy. Even executives who buy into content strategy can fall victim to the traps of corporate politics. The symptoms are varied and include:

- **Lip service:** Lack of serious commitment to content strategy
- **Budget issues:** Lack of appropriate funding
- **Personnel issues:** Resource allocation issues 
- **Gut issues:** Lack of will or clout to invest in content strategy

**Solution:** We’ve all seen it. And there is no sure-fire solution as content strategists often lack the political leverage to counteract these issues. As with the buy-in and ROI issues, gather allies (especially management in the sales and support trenches whose teams deal with users every day). [They can help you make your case][4]. Work with what you have, start small, and [let successful pilot projects highlight the value of content strategy][5]. Evangelize and focus your efforts on [changing the organization’s culture][7]. And above all else: Be tenacious. Don’t give up!
