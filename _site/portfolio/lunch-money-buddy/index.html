<h1 id="lunch-money-buddy">Lunch Money Buddy</h1>

<h2 id="an-app-for-parents">An App for Parents</h2>

<p>Lunch Money Buddy is an application developed as part of the <a href="https://www.kent.edu/slis/uxd">Kent State University Masters in User Experience Design</a> program. The app is described as allowing parents and guardians of school age children to manage various aspects of their kids’ in-school cafeteria lunch accounts.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Any parent can relate to sending their kids to school with a few dollars lunch money and finding it later in a backpack. Picky eaters drive parents crazy trying to keep track of what is being served at school on any given day. Health concious moms and dads want to keep tabs on their kids’ eating habits while at school. Lunch Money Buddy aims to solve all of these challenges in a convenient, easy-to-use mobile application.</p>

<p>Key features of the app include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keeping track of each kid’s <strong>account balance</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Managing funds and payments</strong> for kids’ lunch money</li>
  <li><strong>Viewing upcoming menu</strong> options</li>
  <li><strong>Viewing meal details</strong> including nutritional information and dietary considerations</li>
  <li><strong>Indicating “favorite” meals</strong> for each child in the account</li>
</ul>

<p>While user research was provided at the beginning of the project, I designed and developed all other assets and deliverables.</p>

<h2 id="the-process-design-validate-iterate">The Process: Design, Validate, Iterate</h2>

<p>The overall process can be broken down into a few overarching activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Explore the user needs and workflows</strong> with personas, scenarios and journey maps</li>
  <li><strong>Map an app structure</strong> to those needs and workflows in the form of an app map</li>
  <li>Start <strong>developing screens</strong> to support those activities in the form of wireframes</li>
  <li><strong>Develop prototypes</strong> to test with users</li>
</ul>

<p>Each activity followed a <strong>Design</strong> &gt; <strong>Validate</strong> &gt; <strong>Iterate</strong> process whereby initial design concepts were submitted for peer critique and review and then revised and updated based on feedback.</p>

<h3 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h3>

<p>Throughout the design process, I worked to adhere to some key design principles, based upon my understanding of the users and their needs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Big Three</strong> - Navigation is set up so that the three most important activity groups - <em>Favorites</em>, <em>Payments</em>, and <em>Menu</em> - are easily accessed from most screens</li>
  <li><strong>One-handed Use</strong> - One-handed use of the app was important, as busy parents would be accessing the app while on the go. As such, elements were designed to be forgiving to the inaccuracies of one-handed use.</li>
  <li><strong>Legibility</strong> - We went with relatively large text in the app as well, because we know that some of our users are older or may be using the app in situations where harsh lighting makes reading more difficult.</li>
  <li><strong>Delightful Interaction</strong> - This is an app that our parent personas use out of necessity, but that doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t enjoy using the app. Greater enjoyment will reap greater use of the app and greater traction for the school lunch money program in general.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="personas">Personas</h3>

<p>Two personas were provided by the UX Researcher and included Samantha, a mother of two kids (Hailee and Brenden) and Henry, grandfather and primary caretaker of young Joe.</p>

<h3 id="scenarios-and-journey-maps">Scenarios and Journey Maps</h3>

<p><strong>Tool of choice: Omnigraffle</strong></p>

<p>Scenarios and journey maps were derived using the personas. They explored the needs of the users and how that translated to in-app activities. This helped illuminate and prioritize features.  </p>

<em>A sample scenario/journey map created from the personas and app requirements (click to view the whole thing)</em></a></p>

<h3 id="app-map">App Map</h3>

<p><strong>Tool of choice: Omnigraffle</strong></p>

<p>From the workflows and scenarios, primary activities were identified and an “app map” (similar in concept to the site maps used in website design) for the application was created. This illustrates the architecture of the application.</p>

<p>All of these deliverables are <strong>living documents</strong> that are updated and modified as our understanding of the users’ needs becomes more clear. The app map is great example of this, going through several iterations as each new deliverable was created; continually being refined and honed. </p>

<p><a href="/img/lmb/appmap.png" target="_blank" class="noline"><img src="/img/lmb/appmap.png" class="floatcenter" />
<em>Much like a sitemap used in website design, an appmap shows the overall structure of an app (click to view actual size)</em></a></p>

<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>

<p><strong>Tool of choice: Sketch.app</strong></p>

<p>The app map was then implemented as a series of screens with basic interactions; focused around illustrating screen structure and navigation.</p>

<p>Fidelity of these deliverables started relatively low and increased through multiple iterations. For the most part, however, they were all what I would consider <a href="/fidelity" title="Read more about my thoughts on wireframes and fidelity here">mid-level fidelity</a>.</p>

<em>Examples of wireframing in Sketch  (click to view the whole thing)</em></a></p>

<h3 id="prototype">Prototype</h3>

<p><strong>Tools of choice: Sketch.app, InVision app</strong></p>

<p>For the prototype, higher fidelity screens were created and more focus was given to designing interactions.</p>

<em>Examples of prototype screens created in Sketch (click to view the whole thing)</em></a></p>

<p>The whole thing was laid out in Sketch and imported into InVision for peer review and user testing. This proved to be a very potent pairing <a href="/invision-this" title="Read more about my thoughts on InVision here">which I would recommend</a> to any app designers looking for a nice tradeoff between simplicity and basic features.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<!-- Lessons learned go here -->

<p>This was a moderately sized project with many screens and interactions to keep track of. As such, a big takeaway was the importance of <a href="/organized" title="Read more about my thoughts on staying organized here">working in an organized fashion</a>. Keeping track of all the parts can be daunting and good organizational skills quickly becomes just as important as good design skills.</p>

<p>Also, the value of peer and user feedback was extremely important in producing a better product. The ability to <a href="/critique" title="Read more about my thoughts on critique here">give and receive quality critiques</a> really pushed me and my fellow designers. The <strong>Design</strong> &gt; <strong>Validate</strong> &gt; <strong>Iterate</strong> process proved invaluable in improving the quality of the finished app.</p>

<p>Finally, this project focused heavily on tools and process development. <a href="/know-your-tools" title="Read more about my thoughts an establish toolkit here">Knowing my tools</a> and having (or in some cases developing) a solid kit of templates, typography, and assets really helped with productivity. I also spent a good amount of time developing <a href="/know-your-tools" title="Read more about my thoughts an establish toolkit here">the 16:9 mobile app framework</a> that I used for this project; something that I’ll continue to develop use again on other projects.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Lunch Money Buddy is an app that provides a valuable service to parents of kids who have to work school lunches into their already busy schedule.</p>
