# TeamWork System Builder

## Customizable Collaboration for Conference Rooms and Workspaces

Extron TeamWorkÂ® is a fully customizable collaboration system that can be easily tailored to fit collaboration requirements, for up to eight users. With it, users can share their device's audio and video output on a common screen (like in a conference or board room). The companion [TeamWork System Builder][1] allows customers to choose from a wide range of Extron products to select the switcher, enclosure and "Show Me" cables or Retractors, and IP Link control processor that are best suited for their collaboration environment.

## The Opportunity

Extron's TeamWork line of configurable collaboration offers AV Design Engineers and Consultants with the flexibility they need to provide their customers with state-of-the-art tools that fit their environments. When the product concept was introduced, customers had to work directly with Extron Sales staff to put together an often daunting list of products, accessories, and installation components -- **a time consuming process for both parties**. System requirements are not static throughout an AV design, bid, and installation process, so changes were often complicated and difficult to track.

We designed and built the TeamWork System Builder to allow Extron customers to design their systems on-the-fly in **a simple step-by-step process**, enabling them to easily see which accessories and installation pieces were needed for their specific environment -- all without needing to be on the phone with an Extron support representative.
